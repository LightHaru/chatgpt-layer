/**
 * Main-process bootstrap. Loaded by the asar loader before Codex's own
 * main process code runs. We hook `BrowserWindow` so every window Codex
 * creates gets our preload script attached. We also stand up an IPC
 * channel for tweaks to talk to the main process.
 *
 * We are in CJS land here (matches Electron's main process and Codex's own
 * code). The renderer-side runtime is bundled separately into preload.js.
